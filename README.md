At Paciyin kural, we believe that no one should go to bed hungry. We are a web application dedicated to addressing the
issue of food waste and hunger by connecting those with excess food to those in need. Our platform serves as a bridge,
enabling individuals, businesses, and organizations to make a positive impact in their communities.
With the rapid pace of modern life, food wastage has become a significant concern. Simultaneously,
there are individuals and families struggling to meet their basic nutritional needs.
Paciyin kural aims to close this gap by creating a space where surplus food can find its way to those who need it the most.
Through our user-friendly interface, you can easily share information about excess food you have available.
Whether you're a restaurant with leftover meals, an event organizer with surplus catering, or an individual with extra groceries,
Paciyin kural provides a simple and efficient way to connect with individuals or charitable organizations who can distribute the food to those who are hungry.
Join us in the fight against hunger! Explore Paciyin kural, create an account,
